# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .paul/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** The Linux of Harness Engineering — minimal kernel, modular pals, universal drivers
**Current focus:** Phase 53 unified — ready to plan Phase 54

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.2 Pi Port Audit & Native Fit
Phase: 54 of 3 (Gap Analysis vs Ideal Pi Usage) — Ready to plan
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready for PLAN
Last activity: 2026-03-15 — Unified Phase 53 and transitioned to Phase 54
Progress:
- v2.2 Pi Port Audit & Native Fit: [███░░░░░░░] 33%
- Phase 53: [██████████] 100%

## Loop Position

Current loop state:
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY
  ✓        ✓        ✓     [Loop complete - ready for next PLAN]
```

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Adopt clarity test from Superpowers | 38 | validate_plan checks "could someone with no context execute this?" |
| Adopt dual-goal emphasis from GPT Pilot | 38 | verify=programmatic, done=human-reviewable made explicit |
| Adopt complexity gating from GPT Pilot | 38 | analyze_scope scales plan depth to change size |
| Adapt read-only planning from OpenHands | 38 | plan phase cannot modify source files |
| Reject schema-as-workflow, PageRank, multi-model, tool restriction | 38 | Contradict PALS simplicity or not applicable |
| Defer re-plan protocol to Phase 39 | 38 | Belongs in execution scope |
| Adopt stuck detection, deviation notification, revert-and-refine | 39 | Best execution techniques from 12 frameworks |
| Adapt bounded retries, structured status, re-plan protocol | 39 | Lighter versions of Aider/Superpowers patterns |
| Reject 6 execution techniques | 39 | Handled by host tool or existing PALS mechanisms |
| Adopt anti-pattern injection, failure classification, contract guard | 40 | Best testing techniques from 12 frameworks into TODD |
| Adapt test output reflection, structural coverage, quality heuristics | 40 | Lighter versions of Aider/Continue.dev/BMAD patterns |
| Reject 10 testing techniques | 40 | Multi-agent, IDE-specific, or already adopted |
| Adopt 3-tier severity, failure-to-context, advisory mode, zero-regression rate | 41 | Best quality techniques from 12 frameworks into WALT |
| Adapt small-change exemption, diff-based guidance, event-tagged history, scoped validation | 41 | Lighter versions of SonarQube/reviewdog/lint-staged patterns |
| Reject 10 quality techniques | 41 | Agent domain, over-engineering, or existing mechanisms |
| Adopt retrospective artifacts, offline changes detection, knowledge quality feedback | 42 | Best techniques from Devin/GPT Pilot into UNIFY and resume workflows |
| Adapt context assembly pipeline, interrupted-action recovery, file staleness tracking, convention capture, structured onboarding | 42 | Lighter versions of Windsurf/MetaGPT/Cline/Devin/Cursor patterns |
| Reject 11 techniques (condenser, dual-state, shadow git, autonomous memory, etc.) | 42 | Requires programmatic infrastructure or redundant with existing PALS/Claude Code mechanisms |
| Defer tree-sitter+PageRank repo-map and LSP-powered analysis | 42 | High value but requires programmatic implementation beyond PALS scope |
| Install for ALL detected harnesses (not pick one) | 47 | Both ~/.claude/ and ~/.pi/ get drivers; no prompt needed, no conflict |
| Pi port is artifact-safe and directionally correct as a thin adapter shell | 53 | Confirms later Pi work should refine native fit without abandoning shared markdown artifacts |
| Future Pi work should focus on deeper native runtime/UI usage, not adapter replacement | 53 | Frames Phase 54 around gap analysis and Phase 55 around compatible recommendations |

### Deferred Issues
- ci-generation.md and sonarqube-integration.md — future module candidates
- Agent SDK hook dispatch not implemented
- Tree-sitter repo map deferred
- AGENTS.md deferred to interoperability milestone
- Multi-model routing: implemented in Phase 43 — pals.json `agents` section, agent-dispatch.md reference, apply-phase dispatch logic

### Blockers/Concerns
- None active

### Git State
Branch: feature/53-current-state-audit
Last commit: feat(53): complete current-state audit (HEAD on feature/53-current-state-audit)
PR: #7 merged (v1.1+v1.2 milestones)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-15
Stopped at: Phase 53 complete, ready to plan Phase 54
Next action: /skill:paul-plan
Resume file: .paul/ROADMAP.md
Git strategy: feature/53-current-state-audit
Resume context:
- Phase 53 loop is fully closed with SUMMARY.md recorded
- Phase 54 should compare current Pi usage to an ideal artifact-compatible Pi integration
- Use the Phase 53 audit artifacts as the factual baseline for planning the next step
