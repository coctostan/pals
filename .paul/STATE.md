# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .paul/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)
**Core value:** The Linux of Harness Engineering — minimal kernel, modular pals, universal drivers
**Current focus:** v2.44 PALS Context Optimization — Process & Artifacts is active; Phase 188 is complete and Phase 189 Hot-Path Read Audit is ready to plan.

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.44 PALS Context Optimization — Process & Artifacts
Phase: 189 of 4 in v2.44 — Hot-Path Read Audit — Ready for PLAN
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 188 complete; ready to plan Phase 189
Last activity: 2026-04-27T00:13:53Z — Phase 188 complete, transitioned to Phase 189
Progress:
- v2.42 CODI v0.1 — Post-Unify Instrumentation Fix: [██████████] 100% (CODI v0.1 shipped as good enough; fresh quark validation intentionally skipped)
- v2.43 PALS Context Diet — Archive, Compact, Compress: [██████████] 100% (4 of 4 phases complete)
- v2.44 PALS Context Optimization — Process & Artifacts: [██░░░░░░░░] 25% (1 of 4 phases complete)

## Loop Position

Current loop state:
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY

```

## Accumulated Context

### Current Summary

- PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY remains the authoritative PALS lifecycle loop.
- `.paul/*` artifacts remain lifecycle truth; archives under `.paul/archive/*` are authoritative historical artifacts, not disposable summaries.
- v2.43 completed the first context-diet wave: indexed archives, compact hot artifacts, centralized workflow/module prose, and anti-regrowth validation.
- v2.44 continues context optimization across PALS process and artifacts; Phase 188 reduced recurring prompt/skill wrapper read cost.
- Phase 188 completed workflow prompt/skill slimming: selected wrapper total dropped from 406 to 296 lines while Pi 177/177 and cross-harness 90/90 validation stayed green.
- Phase 189 will audit remaining hot-path reads during normal PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY to identify the next avoidable context costs.

### Current Decisions

| Decision | Source | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Ship CODI v0.1 as good enough and skip fresh quark natural validation | Phase 183 | Future CODI work should be real-usage-driven, not prerequisite to context-diet work. |
| Start v2.43 archive split with indexed cold-history migration from live artifacts | Phase 184 | Phase 185 compacts hot artifacts while preserving lifecycle authority. |
| Archive files remain authoritative historical truth | Phase 185 Plan 185-01 | Hot artifacts may link to cold archives instead of duplicating long history. |
| Prove archive-link mechanics before compacting `STATE.md` | Phase 185 Plan 185-01 | `STATE.md` and `ROADMAP.md` compaction are separate risk-managed waves. |
| Compact `STATE.md` by moving historical accumulated context to `.paul/archive/state/STATE-HISTORY-v0-v2.43.md` | Phase 185 Plan 185-02 | Resume/status stay hot-path complete while old decisions/fixes/deviations/audits remain findable. |
| Define PALS process-level ROADMAP active-window/archive convention | Phase 185 Plan 185-03 | Future roadmap writes keep current routing inline, archive completed detail, and repair bloat without hidden state. |
| Centralize shared dispatch mechanics in `kernel/references/module-dispatch.md` while workflows keep hook-local call-site obligations | Phase 186 Plan 186-01 | Hot PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY workflow prose is shorter without weakening module evidence, post-unify persistence, or merge-gate safety. |
| Guard context-diet gains with semantic validation and a practical line ceiling | Phase 187 Plan 187-01 | Future hot workflow edits must retain lifecycle/module/merge-gate markers and stay under the 1711 Phase 186 pre-compression ceiling. |
| Treat Claude Code command wrappers as legacy/reference thin pointers while keeping Pi skills as the active user-facing surface | Phase 188 Plan 188-01 | Future prompt-slimming should avoid expanding Claude-specific polish unless product strategy changes. |

### Fixes / Deviations / Skill Audits

- Historical fix log, deviation log, and skill audit tables through Phase 185 Plan 185-01 are archived in [.paul/archive/state/STATE-HISTORY-v0-v2.43.md](archive/state/STATE-HISTORY-v0-v2.43.md).
- Phase 188 auto-fixed initial Pi validation marker loss by restoring exact guardrail phrases in thinner Pi skill wrappers; final validation passed.

### Deferred Issues

- ci-generation.md and sonarqube-integration.md — future module candidates.
- Agent SDK hook dispatch shelved — not an active milestone driver.
- Tree-sitter repo map deferred.
- Multi-model routing exists via `pals.json` `agents`, `agent-dispatch.md`, and apply-phase dispatch logic.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Future work should preserve artifact-first truth and resist telemetry, Pi-owned execution state, or reopening the settled Phase 69/70 contract without new evidence.
- v2.44 slimming must not weaken PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY, GitHub Flow, module dispatch, archive authority, or parent-owned APPLY boundaries; future work should clarify Claude Code support tier before investing in Claude-specific polish.
