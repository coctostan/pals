## Accumulated Context
### Decisions
| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Adopt clarity test from Superpowers | 38 | validate_plan checks "could someone with no context execute this?" |
| Adopt dual-goal emphasis from GPT Pilot | 38 | verify=programmatic, done=human-reviewable made explicit |
| Adopt complexity gating from GPT Pilot | 38 | analyze_scope scales plan depth to change size |
| Adapt read-only planning from OpenHands | 38 | plan phase cannot modify source files |
| Reject schema-as-workflow, PageRank, multi-model, tool restriction | 38 | Contradict PALS simplicity or not applicable |
| Defer re-plan protocol to Phase 39 | 38 | Belongs in execution scope |
| Adopt stuck detection, deviation notification, revert-and-refine | 39 | Best execution techniques from 12 frameworks |
| Adapt bounded retries, structured status, re-plan protocol | 39 | Lighter versions of Aider/Superpowers patterns |
| Reject 6 execution techniques | 39 | Handled by host tool or existing PALS mechanisms |
| Adopt anti-pattern injection, failure classification, contract guard | 40 | Best testing techniques from 12 frameworks into TODD |
| Adapt test output reflection, structural coverage, quality heuristics | 40 | Lighter versions of Aider/Continue.dev/BMAD patterns |
| Reject 10 testing techniques | 40 | Multi-agent, IDE-specific, or already adopted |
| Adopt 3-tier severity, failure-to-context, advisory mode, zero-regression rate | 41 | Best quality techniques from 12 frameworks into WALT |
| Adapt small-change exemption, diff-based guidance, event-tagged history, scoped validation | 41 | Lighter versions of SonarQube/reviewdog/lint-staged patterns |
| Reject 10 quality techniques | 41 | Agent domain, over-engineering, or existing mechanisms |
| Adopt retrospective artifacts, offline changes detection, knowledge quality feedback | 42 | Best techniques from Devin/GPT Pilot into UNIFY and resume workflows |
| Adapt context assembly pipeline, interrupted-action recovery, file staleness tracking, convention capture, structured onboarding | 42 | Lighter versions of Windsurf/MetaGPT/Cline/Devin/Cursor patterns |
| Reject 11 techniques (condenser, dual-state, shadow git, autonomous memory, etc.) | 42 | Requires programmatic infrastructure or redundant with existing PALS/Claude Code mechanisms |
| Defer tree-sitter+PageRank repo-map and LSP-powered analysis | 42 | High value but requires programmatic implementation beyond PALS scope |
| Install for ALL detected harnesses (not pick one) | 47 | Both ~/.claude/ and ~/.pi/ get drivers; no prompt needed, no conflict |
| Pi port is artifact-safe and directionally correct as a thin adapter shell | 53 | Confirms later Pi work should refine native fit without abandoning shared markdown artifacts |
| Future Pi work should focus on deeper native runtime/UI usage, not adapter replacement | 53 | Frames Phase 54 around gap analysis and Phase 55 around compatible recommendations |
| PALS needs a more mature Pi-native shell around the existing artifact-safe architecture, not a Pi-specific redesign | 54 | Keeps Phase 55 focused on recommendations that deepen native fit without changing core workflow truth |
| Prioritize context injection, command ergonomics, and lifecycle visibility as the highest-value Pi improvement areas | 54 | Gives the recommendation phase a clear ranking frame for roadmap shaping |
| v2.3 should focus first on interaction model refinement: context strategy, command discoverability, and adapter consistency | 55 | Establishes the concrete next milestone direction after v2.2 closeout |
| Rank Pi improvements by user value, risk, and compatibility posture instead of treating all ideas equally | 55 | Creates the roadmap structure for safe-now, careful-layering, and future-state work |
| Prefer a hybrid Pi event model over a single-hook redesign | 56 | Clarifies responsibility split across orientation, activation, and injection without creating Pi-only truth |
| Make `before_agent_start` the primary workflow-context decision point | 56 | Gives later implementation work a stronger timing boundary than the regex-driven `context` hook |
| Reduce `context` to a narrow supporting role while keeping `.paul/*` authoritative | 56 | Preserves artifact-first lifecycle truth while still allowing targeted prompt shaping |
| Reuse one shared lifecycle snapshot for Pi notifications, status, widget, and injected context | 59 | Keeps Pi lifecycle semantics aligned across all visible adapter surfaces |
| Keep Pi quick actions bounded and route shortcut entry points through the existing wrapper layer | 60 | Preserves low-clutter UX while avoiding Pi-only workflow semantics or duplicate routing logic |
| 2026-03-16: Treated TODD/WALT as installed Pi module overlays via modules.yaml and workflow dispatch rather than standalone skills during APPLY | 61 | Resolved first Pi end-to-end execution ambiguity without changing canonical workflow ownership |
| 2026-03-16: Implemented Phase 62 hybrid runtime refinement with explicit command activation budgeting, `before_agent_start` primary injection, and `context` normalization-only support | 62 | Preserves one bounded automatic injection path while keeping `.paul/*` as authoritative lifecycle truth |
| 2026-03-16: Keep Pi guided workflow UX marker-driven and route explicit continuations through `pi.sendUserMessage` without adding Pi-owned lifecycle state | 63 | Preserves shared workflow ownership while making approvals, checkpoints, resume routing, and transitions easier inside Pi |
| 2026-03-16: Use `matchAll(/[✓○]/g)` count for loop badge; "success" notify only for confirmed sends/routes | 64 | Keeps UX enrichment simple, robust, and bounded to additive cosmetic changes without regression risk |
### Fixes
| Fix | Phase | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Fix 02 (standard): Reworked installed module registries to include `hook_details`, aligned PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY dispatch wording to the installed registry, and added validation coverage | Phase 63 | Enabled modules can now be consulted from real installed `modules.yaml` registries instead of relying on conceptual source-manifest access |
### Deviations
| Deviation | Phase | Impact |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Skill audit gap: `/carl`, `TODD`, and `WALT` were not explicitly invoked during Phase 62 APPLY/UNIFY | 62 | Advisory-only; implementation stayed in scope and validations passed (93/93), but workflow discipline should be tightened next phase |

### Deferred Issues
- ci-generation.md and sonarqube-integration.md — future module candidates
- Agent SDK hook dispatch shelved — not an active milestone driver
- Tree-sitter repo map deferred
- AGENTS.md deferred to interoperability milestone
- Multi-model routing: implemented in Phase 43 — pals.json `agents` section, agent-dispatch.md reference, apply-phase dispatch logic
### Blockers/Concerns
- None active
### Git State
Branch: main
Last commit: HEAD (phase 64 completion commit)
Feature branches merged: none (direct-to-main for Phase 64)
Remote status: remote not configured (pals.json git.remote = null), so no push/PR automation executed
## Session Continuity
