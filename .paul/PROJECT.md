# Project: pals

## Description
PALS - Project Automation & Lifecycle System. Based on PAUL and CARL along with their pals TODD and WALT. They team up to give users the agentic coding framework that makes development friendly.

## Core Value
The ultimate user friendly end-to-end Claude Code software development framework

## Requirements

### Must Have
- Unified ~/.pals/ directory structure housing all components
- /pals:* command namespace replacing /paul:*
- CARL as native component with /carl:* namespace retained
- TODD/WALT integrated as named subsystems (no indirection)
- Single install script from git clone

### Should Have
- Clean migration path from existing PAUL/CARL installs
- Complete @-reference rewiring across all files

### Nice to Have
- ✓ Uninstall/cleanup script — Phase 5
- ✓ Getting-started documentation — Phase 5

### Validated
- ✓ Architecture fully mapped (111 files across 4 components) — Phase 1
- ✓ Unified structure designed (105 destinations, 6 consolidations) — Phase 1
- ✓ PALS repo structure created with 96 PAUL files migrated — Phase 2
- ✓ /pals:* command namespace replacing /paul:* — Phase 2
- ✓ All @-references rewritten to ~/.pals/ paths — Phase 2
- ✓ TODD/WALT integrated as named subsystems (no indirection) — Phase 3
- ✓ CARL as native component with /carl:* namespace retained — Phase 4
- ✓ Single install script from git clone — Phase 5
- ✓ Uninstall/cleanup script — Phase 5
- ✓ Getting-started documentation (README.md) — Phase 5

## Constraints
- CARL remains architecturally independent (hook-level integration only)
- TODD/WALT have no standalone operation — always PALS-native
- /carl:* namespace preserved (not merged into /pals:*)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| CARL is fully independent (hook-level integration) | 1 | No file-level refs between CARL and PAUL |
| TODD/WALT are named integrated subsystems, retain identity | 1 (revised) | Steps labeled TODD:/WALT: in workflows, no separate directories |
| Flat workflows/ directory (no TODD/WALT subdirs) | 1 | TODD/WALT steps inline in parent workflows |
| CARL gets own subdirectory (~/.pals/carl/) | 1 | Independent runtime config, not docs |
| /pals:* namespace, /carl:* retained | 1 | Unified brand + CARL independence |
| TODD workflows reclassified as references | 1 (revised) | TDD specs stay self-contained, referenced natively from plan/apply |
| Preserve all subsystem names (TODD, WALT, PAUL, CARL) | 3 | User directive — integration not erasure |

## Success Criteria
- The ultimate user friendly end-to-end Claude Code software development framework is achieved
- Single `git clone` + install script gets PALS working
- Full PLAN-APPLY-UNIFY loop works on test project

- /carl → Context rules & domain configuration
- TODD → Test-driven development enforcement
- WALT → Quality gating & validation
